 * Total Accepted:    5.1K
 * Total Submissions: 7.7K
 * Testcase Example:  '[5,7,3,9,4,9,8,3,1]'
 *
 * Given an array of integers A, return the largest integer that only occurs
 * once.
 * 
 * If no integer occurs once, return -1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [5,7,3,9,4,9,8,3,1]
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation: 
 * The maximum integer in the array is 9 but it is repeated. The number 8
 * occurs only once, so it's the answer.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [9,9,8,8]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: 
 * There is no number that occurs only once.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= A.length <= 2000
 * 0 <= A[i] <= 1000
