 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,-3,3,1]'
 *
 * Given the head of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences
 * of nodes that sum to 0 until there are no such sequences.
 * 
 * After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.  You may return
 * any such answer.
 * 
 * 
 * (Note that in the examples below, all sequences are serializations of
 * ListNode objects.)
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [1,2,-3,3,1]
 * Output: [3,1]
 * Note: The answer [1,2,1] would also be accepted.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,4]
 * Output: [1,2,4]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,-2]
 * Output: [1]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The given linked list will contain between 1 and 1000 nodes.
 * Each node in the linked list has -1000 <= node.val <= 1000.
