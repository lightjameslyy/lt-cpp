 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4,5]\n[1,2,5,7,9]\n[1,3,4,5,8]'
 *
 * Given three integer arrays arr1, arr2 and arr3 sorted in strictly increasing
 * order, return a sorted array of only the integers that appeared in all three
 * arrays.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5], arr2 = [1,2,5,7,9], arr3 = [1,3,4,5,8]
 * Output: [1,5]
 * Explanation: Only 1 and 5 appeared in the three arrays.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length, arr3.length <= 1000
 * 1 <= arr1[i], arr2[i], arr3[i] <= 2000
 *
