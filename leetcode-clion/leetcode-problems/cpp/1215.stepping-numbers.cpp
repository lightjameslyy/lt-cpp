 *
 * A Stepping Number is an integer such that all of its adjacent digits have an
 * absolute difference of exactly 1. For example, 321 is a Stepping Number
 * while 421 is not.
 * 
 * Given two integers low and high, find and return a sorted list of all the
 * Stepping Numbers in the range [low, high] inclusive.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: low = 0, high = 21
 * Output: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,21]
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 0 <= low <= high <= 2 * 10^9
