 * Testcase Example:  '[0.4]\n1'
 *
 * You have some coins.  The i-th coin has a probability prob[i] of facing
 * heads when tossed.
 * 
 * Return the probability that the number of coins facing heads equals target
 * if you toss every coin exactly once.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: prob = [0.4], target = 1
 * Output: 0.40000
 * Example 2:
 * Input: prob = [0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5], target = 0
 * Output: 0.03125
 *

 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= prob.length <= 1000
 * 0 <= prob[i] <= 1
 * 0 <= target <= prob.length
 * Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct
 * answer.
