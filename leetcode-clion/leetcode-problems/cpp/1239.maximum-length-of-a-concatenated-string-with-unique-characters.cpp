 * of arr which have unique characters.
 * 
 * Return the maximum possible length of s.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr = ["un","iq","ue"]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: All possible concatenations are "","un","iq","ue","uniq" and

 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr = ["cha","r","act","ers"]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: Possible solutions are "chaers" and "acters".

 * 
 * 
 * Input: arr = ["abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"]
 * Output: 26
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
