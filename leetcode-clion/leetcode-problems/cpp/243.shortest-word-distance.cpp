 * Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest
 * distance between these two words in the list.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
 * 
 * 
 * Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”

 * 
 * Note:
 * You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are
 * both in the list.
