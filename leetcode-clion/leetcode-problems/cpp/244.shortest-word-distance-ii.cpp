 * Testcase Example:  '["WordDistance","shortest","shortest"]\n' +
  '[[["practice","makes","perfect","coding","makes"]],["coding","practice"],["makes","coding"]]'
 *
 * Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and
 * implements a method that takes two words word1 and word2 and return the
 * shortest distance between these two words in the list. Your method will be
 * called repeatedly many times with different parameters. 
 * 
 * Example:
 * Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
 * 
 * 
 * Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
 * Output: 3
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * Note:
 * You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are
 * both in the list.
