 *
 * Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest
 * distance between these two words in the list.
 * 
 * word1 and word2 may be the same and they represent two individual words in
 * the list.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
 * 
 * 
 * Input: word1 = “makes”, word2 = “coding”
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "makes"
 * Output: 3
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * You may assume word1 and word2 are both in the list.
