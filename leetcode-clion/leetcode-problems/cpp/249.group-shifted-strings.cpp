 * Testcase Example:  '["abc","bcd","acef","xyz","az","ba","a","z"]'
 *
 * Given a string, we can "shift" each of its letter to its successive letter,
 * for example: "abc" -> "bcd". We can keep "shifting" which forms the
 * sequence:
 * 
 * 
 * "abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz"
 * 
 * Given a list of strings which contains only lowercase alphabets, group all
 * strings that belong to the same shifting sequence.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: ["abc", "bcd", "acef", "xyz", "az", "ba", "a", "z"],
 * Output: 
 * [
 * ⁠ ["abc","bcd","xyz"],
 * ⁠ ["az","ba"],
 * ⁠ ["acef"],
 * ⁠ ["a","z"]
 * ]
