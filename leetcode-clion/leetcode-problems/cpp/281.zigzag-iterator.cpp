 * Medium (56.97%)
 * Total Accepted:    57.5K
 * Total Submissions: 101K
 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2]\n[3,4,5,6]'
 *
 * Given two 1d vectors, implement an iterator to return their elements
 * alternately.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * v1 = [1,2]
 * v2 = [3,4,5,6] 
 * 
 * Output: [1,3,2,4,5,6]
 * 
 * Explanation:Â By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns
 * false, 
 * the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,3,2,4,5,6].
 * 
 * Follow up: What if you are given k 1d vectors? How well can your code be
 * extended to such cases?
 * 
 * Clarification for the follow up question:
 * The "Zigzag" order is not clearly defined and is ambiguous for k > 2 cases.
 * If "Zigzag" does not look right to you, replace "Zigzag" with "Cyclic". For
 * example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * [1,2,3]
 * [4,5,6,7]
 * [8,9]
 * 
 * Output: [1,4,8,2,5,9,3,6,7].
