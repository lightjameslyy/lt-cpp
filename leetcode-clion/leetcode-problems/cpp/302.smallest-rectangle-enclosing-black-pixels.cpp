 * An image is represented by a binary matrix with 0 as a white pixel and 1 as
 * a black pixel. The black pixels are connected, i.e., there is only one black
 * region. Pixels are connected horizontally and vertically. Given the location
 * (x, y) of one of the black pixels, return the area of the smallest
 * (axis-aligned) rectangle that encloses all black pixels.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * [
 * ⁠ "0010",
 * ⁠ "0110",
 * ⁠ "0100"
 * ]
 * and x = 0, y = 2
