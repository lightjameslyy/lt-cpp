 *
 * Given a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this:
 * Collect and remove all leaves, repeat until the tree is empty.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
 * 
 * 1
 * ⁠        / \
 * ⁠       2   3
 * ⁠      / \     
 * ⁠     4   5    
 * 
 * Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * 1. Removing the leaves [4,5,3] would result in this tree:
 * 
 * 
 * ⁠         1
 * ⁠        / 
 * ⁠       2          
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 2. Now removing the leaf [2] would result in this tree:
 * 
 * 
 * ⁠         1          
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 3. Now removing the leaf [1] would result in the empty tree:
 * 
 * 
 * ⁠         []         
 *
