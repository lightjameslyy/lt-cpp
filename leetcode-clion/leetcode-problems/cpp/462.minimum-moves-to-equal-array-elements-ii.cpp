 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3]'
 *
 * Given a non-empty integer array, find the minimum number of moves required
 * to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing a selected
 * element by 1 or decrementing a selected element by 1.
 * 
 * You may assume the array's length is at most 10,000.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input:
 * [1,2,3]
 * 
 * Output:
 * 2
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one
 * element):
 * 
 * [1,2,3]  =>  [2,2,3]  =>  [2,2,2]
 *
