 * Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in
 * this string.
 * 
 * The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as
 * different substrings even they consist of same characters.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "abc"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "aaa"
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
 *

 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The input string length won't exceed 1000.
